# How to do breakout rooms

- Introduce yourself
- Pick someone to share their screen and take notes/write code
- Discuss the problem

## Types of problems

I'll generally pose two kinds of problems, discussions and programming tasks.

For the discussion tasks, the goal is to discuss a problem and come to some (dis)agreement. This means arriving at some points that can be discussed with the whole class after the breakout room.

For the programming tasks, the goal is to "solve" some programming task. This does not mean programming a complete solution, but for everyone involved to think about, discuss, and experiment with some code for some purpose.

## Different roles

If the problem is easy, your job is to ensure everyone has the same understanding as you.
- Explain your approach (when writing code - explain every step)
- Ask for other viewpoints
- Help everyone understand

If the problem is difficult, your job is to understand.
- Ask questions
- Stop others from racing ahead of you - remember their job is to help you understand!

What does the code in `particles.py` do?

10 minute discussion in breakout rooms.

I will walk through the code afterwards.
