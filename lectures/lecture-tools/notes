# These are my notes for the lecture - in case I forget something

# Running the code

python particles.py # fails with missing pygame

python -m venv venv # set up virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate # activates venv
pip install pygame # install pygame

python particles.py

## Profiling

python -m cProfile particles.py

# Shows that pygame.image.load is the culprit
## Very many calls, why load the image so many times?
# easy fix - we load an image at the start and re-use it!

## Debugging

# Some particles get stuck

add
elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
  import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
in event loop

dir() to find particles
dir(particles[0]) to see the interface for the particles
particles[0].speed and particles[0].direction

see that the issue comes when the speed is very low

fix by changing move()
replace by
self.position += self.direction * time_delta
self.direction.y += (GRAVITY  * time_delta)


## Static checking

run pylint
fix issues

## Runtime checking

add mem = pympler.tracker.SummaryTracker() before main loop

on quit: mem.print_diff()
